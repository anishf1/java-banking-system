Java Banking System GUI 

By using NetBeans 13 and Java, I created a banking software with a GUI that uses software principles such as one-to-many relationships, polymorphism, and inheritance. The banking system allows users to view and edit their personal information, transfer funds between different accounts, and is able to allow certain access to different classes for different types of users which are grouped as Clients, Managers, Employees, and Administrators. User data is stored on an external file which gets updated in real time. This project helped improve my understanding of how object-oriented programming works in Java.
